# Resume_Workshop

The purpose of this repository is to help teach individuals on how to construct a Resume from scratch. It will also teach you the contents of what to put in a portfolio and how to approach the interview process. This repository consists of 2 documents that will accomplish that. These documents are the resume outline, and the workshop PDF. The purpose of the outline is to go into further detail of the Workshop PDF. The PDF is meant to teach larger groups of people.  

Update (7/20/2023): I added my resume to this with comments on the basic formatting. If you don't want to read through my documents this is the quickest way to get an idea of how your resume should look if you want to maximize your interview potential.
